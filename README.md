# ToDO List App

This is a lightweight web application developed using JavaScript and the React.js library. It enables users to input and add tasks to a dynamic to-do list. The application includes persistent data storage, ensuring that tasks remain saved and accessible even after the page is refreshed or closed.

## Description
This application is simple but has the most necessary features needed in a 'To Do' list 
1. **Add Tasks**
2. **Delete Tasks**
3. **Set Task Higher in list**
4. **Set Task Lower in list**

## Why I built this Application
1. To understand how to use React
2. Understand and implement useState hook
3. Understand and implement useEffect hook

I developed this project to reinforce key concepts, such as the use of React hooks, in a simpler context. Additionally, I aimed to practice essential skills like adding projects to GitHub and writing documentation, both of which are crucial in the software development field. Working on a smaller project allowed me to solidify my understanding while honing other valuable skills.

## Challenges Faced
The primary challenge I faced was understanding the useEffect hook and its application in this project. I consulted the official React documentation and learned that useEffect handles side effects after a component re-renders. I then used it to synchronize tasks with local storage.

## Future Improvements and Features
* Add a dark Mode button that changes the colours of the page
* Add a circular checkbox to check a task that has been done
